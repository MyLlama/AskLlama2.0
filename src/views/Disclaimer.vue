        <li>
          AskLlama is an artificial intelligence program that doesnâ€™t take
          itself too seriously. Hope you don't too ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™ƒ
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          As much as we love our AskLlama characters, they are not the originals
          but only representations. Don't worry though, they still have all the
          personality and charm of the original Masters ðŸ˜Ž
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          AskLlama responses are for informational purposes only and should not
          be treated as sage advice. So, if you're looking to quit your job and
          become a llama herder because of something we said, maybe double check
          with an actual professional first.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          AskLlama may occasionally provide inaccurate information or use humour
          (our best quality obviously) that may not be everyoneâ€™s cup of tea.
        </li>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>
          Ask away, but don't sue us if it gets sassy! We're just a bunch of
          llamas trying to make your day a little brighter!
