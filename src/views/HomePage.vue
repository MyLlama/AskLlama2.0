            AskLlama is an artificial intelligence program that doesnâ€™t take
            itself too seriously. Hope you don't too ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™ƒ
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            As much as we love our AskLlama characters, they are not the
            originals but only representations. Don't worry though, they still
            have all the personality and charm of the original Masters ðŸ˜Ž

          <br />
          <li>
            AskLlama responses are for informational purposes only and should
            not be treated as sage advice. So, if you're looking to quit your
            job and become a llama herder because of something we said, maybe
            double check with an actual professional first.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            AskLlama may occasionally provide inaccurate information or use
            humour (our best quality obviously) that may not be everyoneâ€™s cup
            of tea.

            Ask away, but don't sue us if it gets sassy! We're just a bunch of
            llamas trying to make your day a little brighter!
